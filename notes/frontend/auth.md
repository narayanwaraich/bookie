__1. Enhanced User Experience & UI Refinements:__

- __Password Strength Indicator:__

  - On the registration and password reset pages, provide real-time feedback on password strength (e.g., using a library like `zxcvbn`).
  - Visually show criteria being met (e.g., min length, uppercase, number, special character).

- __"Show/Hide Password" Toggle:__ Add an icon/button to toggle password visibility on all password input fields.

- __"Forgot Password?" Flow:__

  - Add a "Forgot Password?" link on the Login page.
  - Create a new page/route (`/forgot-password`) where users can enter their email to request a password reset link. This would call the `auth.requestPasswordReset` tRPC mutation.
  - Create another page/route (`/reset-password?token=...`) where users can enter a new password after clicking the link in the reset email. This would use the `auth.resetPassword` tRPC mutation.

- __Loading States & Feedback:__

  - Ensure all buttons have clear loading indicators (e.g., spinner within the button, disabling the button). We've done this for submit buttons, but consider it for any other async actions.
  - Use more specific error messages from the backend where appropriate, or map backend error codes to user-friendly messages.

- __Accessibility (A11y):__

  - Review all forms and components for proper ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility.
  - Ensure sufficient color contrast.

- __Responsive Design:__ Thoroughly test and refine the UI on various screen sizes. Shadcn/ui components are generally responsive, but custom layouts might need adjustments.

- __"Resend Verification Email" Option:__
  - On the login page (or a dedicated "check your email" page after registration), if a user tries to log in with an unverified email, offer an option to resend the verification email. This would require a new backend endpoint.

__2. Security Enhancements (Frontend Perspective):__

- __Rate Limiting Feedback:__ If the backend implements rate limiting for login/registration attempts, the frontend should gracefully handle these errors (e.g., "Too many attempts, please try again later.").
- __Clearer Session Expiry Handling:__ While the `AuthProvider` handles token refresh, ensure the user experience is smooth if a refresh fails and the user is logged out (e.g., a clear message and redirect to login).

__3. Code Quality & Maintainability:__

- __Shared Zod Schemas:__ If not already done, explore sharing Zod schemas between frontend and backend (e.g., via a shared `common` package or by carefully importing from the backend if the project setup allows). This reduces duplication for validation logic (e.g., `registerUserSchema`).
- __Component Abstraction:__ If forms become very complex or similar form sections are reused, consider creating more abstract form field components.
- __Internationalization (i18n):__ If the application needs to support multiple languages, plan for i18n by extracting all user-facing strings into resource files.
- __E2E Testing:__ Implement end-to-end tests for the authentication flows (registration, login, verification, password reset) using a framework like Playwright or Cypress.

__4. Feature Additions:__

- __Social Logins (OAuth):__

  - Integrate options for "Login with Google/GitHub/etc."
  - This involves significant backend work but also frontend UI elements and handling OAuth redirects.

- __Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):__

  - After password login, prompt for a 2FA code (e.g., from an authenticator app).
  - Provide UI for setting up 2FA.

- __"Remember Me" Functionality:__

  - Add a "Remember Me" checkbox on the login page.
  - This would typically involve using longer-lived refresh tokens or a different session management strategy on the backend.

- __Profile Page / Account Management:__
  - Once logged in, users will need a page to manage their account (e.g., change password, update profile information, manage email verification status).

__Immediate Next Steps I'd Suggest (based on impact and common needs):__

1. __"Forgot Password?" Flow:__ This is a critical feature for most applications.
2. __"Show/Hide Password" Toggle:__ A small but very useful UX improvement.
3. __Refine Error Handling & User Feedback:__ Make sure error messages are consistently user-friendly.
